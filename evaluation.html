<h2>Episode E136: Diarization Architecture Iteration</h2>

<p>
Episode E136 exposed instability under interruption-dense conversational speech.
The failure was not singular — it occurred at multiple layers of the pipeline.
Below is the architectural progression.

<hr>

<h3>1. Pyannote Baseline (Embedding + Boundary Instability)</h3>

<pre><code>{
  "diarization_source": "PYANNOTE",
  "turns": [
    {
      "speaker": "Friedberg",
      "start": 1.309,
      "end": 7.09,
      "text": "Let me get everything queued up here..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chamath",
      "start": 7.11,
      "end": 8.791,
      "text": "Hey, everybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Friedberg",
      "start": 7.343,
      "end": 10.991,
      "text": "Hey, everybody. Yeah, do it, Chamath."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPEAKER_UNKNOWN",
      "start": 25.274,
      "end": 25.474,
      "text": "He's"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "speaker_3",
      "start": 25.514,
      "end": 26.894,
      "text": "not even here..."
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

<p>
Observed:
• Overlapping intervals  
• Sub-2 second micro-fragments  
• UNKNOWN sandwich artifacts  
• Oscillatory boundary flips under cross-talk  
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. NeMo RTTM Injection (No Force Alignment)</h3>

<p>
Switching to NeMo TitaNet-L embeddings improved cluster cohesion,
but naïvely injecting RTTM intervals without reconciling WhisperX
word-level timestamps introduced lexical fragmentation.
</p>

<pre><code>{
  "diarization_source": "NEMO",
  "alignment_strategy": "raw_rttm_injection",
  "turns": [
    {
      "speaker": "speaker_3",
      "start": 7.11,
      "end": 8.791,
      "text": "Hey,"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "speaker_3",
      "start": 8.811,
      "end": 10.991,
      "text": "everybody. Hey, everybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPEAKER_UNKNOWN",
      "start": 25.274,
      "end": 25.474,
      "text": "He's"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

<p>
Observed:
• Word-level splits inside lexical units  
• Artificial UNKNOWN fragments mid-token  
• ASR timestamp / RTTM boundary mismatch  
</p>

<p>
This demonstrated that diarization stability alone is insufficient.
Temporal reconciliation between ASR word alignment and diarization
segments is required to prevent semantic fragmentation.
</p>

<h3>3. NeMo + Force-Aligned Reconciliation (Final Architecture)</h3>

<pre><code>{
  "diarization_source": "NEMO",
  "alignment_strategy": "force_aligned_merge",
  "segments": [
    {
      "start": 1.309,
      "end": 10.991,
      "speaker": "friedberg",
      "text": "Let me get everything queued up here... Hey, everybody. Yeah, do it, Chamath."
    },
    {
      "start": 12.011,
      "end": 18.793,
      "speaker": "chamath",
      "text": "Hey, everybody. I'm Jcal..."
    },
    {
      "start": 18.853,
      "end": 29.715,
      "speaker": "friedberg",
      "text": "He's not even here. You can't do that. It's awful."
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>

<p>
Result:
• Same-speaker batching restored  
• UNKNOWN inflation eliminated  
• Reduced boundary oscillation  
• Preserved semantic continuity  
• Stable canonical dataset export  
</p>

<p>
Episode E136 served as the inflection point for revising the diarization subsystem
from a model-only dependency to a multi-layer reconciled architecture.
