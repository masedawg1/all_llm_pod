    <h1>Diarization Model Evaluation</h1>
    <p>Comparative analysis of diarization architectures under high-interruption panel conditions.</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        Evaluate speaker diarization stability and transcription fidelity in multi-speaker,
        interruption-dense podcast environments (~37–48% of segments under 4 seconds).
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Architectures Compared</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> WhisperX + Pyannote embeddings</li>
        <li><strong>Proposed:</strong> WhisperX + NeMo TitaNet-L (multiscale embeddings)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Evaluation Dimensions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Embedding cluster cohesion (geometric separability)</li>
        <li>Speaker fragmentation rate</li>
        <li>Short-segment robustness (&lt;4s)</li>
        <li>Unknown “sandwich” artifact frequency</li>
        <li>Cross-modal validation (face presence vs diarized speaker)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Embedding Geometry Analysis</h2>

    <h3>NeMo TitaNet-L</h3>
    <p>
        Multiscale embeddings demonstrated tighter intra-speaker clustering and reduced
        fragmentation under rapid turn-taking conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Pyannote</h3>
    <p>
        Higher dispersion and speaker-ID inflation observed in interruption-dense regions,
        suggesting greater sensitivity to short-window variance.
    </p>

    <p>
        High short-segment density increases embedding variance and exposes diarization instability.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Cross-Modal Validation</h2>
    <p>
        Diarized speaker assignments were correlated against sampled face-presence detection
        (segment start / midpoint / end). Persistent contradictions between audio attribution
        and visual presence were treated as instability indicators.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sampling-based validation preserved computational feasibility while maintaining signal integrity.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Under interruption-heavy, multi-host panel conditions, NeMo TitaNet-L multiscale embeddings
        demonstrated improved cluster cohesion, reduced speaker fragmentation, and stronger
        cross-modal alignment relative to the Pyannote baseline.
    </p>

    <p>
        Final architecture selection was based on embedding stability, attribution consistency,
        and downstream dataset integrity requirements.
